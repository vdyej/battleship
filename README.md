# Purse Dig!
It's a battleship-like game based on some Head First textbook code. But, since I couldn't identify with sinking ships, my game is finding 3 loose keys in a purse. ;) I made custom graphics accordingly.
I also upped the usability by adding features (an initial instructions page, a key tracker at top right, and a New Game button).
